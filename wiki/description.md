### The inspiration of our project

During a holiday in 2024, one of our team members, Wanting ZOU, noticed a lipstick labeled “natural plant-derived squalane” while shopping in a mall. She was puzzled by the juxtaposition of the term “plant” with the shark-derived component and its description as “natural.” This observation piqued our curiosity and prompted us to investigate the compound, through which we learned about squalene, a high-value ingredient used in cosmetics.

> Squalene V.S. Squalane: Squalane is a saturated form of squalene in which the double bonds have been eliminated by hydrogenation. 
> The hydrogenation process creates a stable form of the molecule, while also making the oil softer, thinner, and more skin-friendly. Because squalane is less susceptible to oxidation, is odorless, and has a longer efficacy, it is more commonly used in personal care products than squalene.
