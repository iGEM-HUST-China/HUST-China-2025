## Our Model

Engineering peroxisomal protein targeting and rewiring central carbon metabolism in *Yarrowia lipolytica* poses a formidable design challenge: the import efficiency of linker–signal peptides, the catalytic bottleneck imposed by pathway rate-limiting enzymes, and the nonlinear dynamics of growth under complex carbon sources are deeply intertwined. Trial-and-error approaches alone cannot efficiently resolve this multi-layered problem.

To bridge this gap, we established a **hierarchical in silico pipeline** that acts as a digital twin of our PICasSO-inspired engineering strategy, enabling rational design and predictive prototyping.

### Molecular Layer — Peptide–Enzyme Docking

At the molecular interface, we employed **HADDOCK-based peptide–enzyme docking** to interrogate the binding determinants of classical and extended PTS1 variants (*SKL*, *GGGSSKL*, *TYWIRFSKL*). These simulations uncovered the energetic and structural principles that govern efficient recognition by **PEX5** and defined rational rules for designing import signals.

### Enzyme Layer — AI-Guided Sequence Redesign

To relieve metabolic bottlenecks, we targeted the **rate-limiting enzyme of the MVA pathway**. Using **ProteinMPNN**, we performed *de novo* sequence redesign to generate optimized variants, followed by **Rosetta FastRelax** refinement to minimize conformational strain energy. This computational protein engineering strategy yielded enzyme variants with enhanced stability and binding properties, thereby providing a robust starting point for experimental implementation.

### Systems Layer — Machine Learning Growth Modeling

To connect molecular insights with systems-level behavior, we constructed a **machine learning–driven growth modeling framework**. Experimental OD₆₀₀ kinetics were first parameterized using **Gompertz** and **spline** fits, extracting μₘₐₓ, λ, and K. These kinetic features, combined with medium composition variables, were used to train **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** models capable of forecasting growth performance under novel carbon-source combinations. This predictive capacity enables extrapolation beyond measured conditions and provides a quantitative basis for rational medium optimization.

### Integration and Impact

By fusing **molecular docking**, **AI-guided enzyme redesign**, and **machine learning–based systems modeling** into a unified framework, our model enables *in silico* prototyping of peroxisomal targeting and metabolic rewiring. This **model-driven strategy** transforms the traditional **Design–Build–Test–Learn (DBTL)** cycle into a **predictive, knowledge-**

# I. Linker–Signal Peptide System Docking

**Signal-peptide & linker selection · Molecular docking · Energy analysis**

## Background & Rationale

Peroxisomal protein import relies on **peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS)** and their cytosolic receptors.  
Two major types exist: **PTS1**, a canonical C-terminal tripeptide such as –SKL, and **PTS2**, a nonapeptide motif near the N-terminus.  
Among these, **PTS1** is the most conserved and widely used signal across eukaryotes.

The cytosolic receptor **PEX5** specifically recognizes PTS1-containing proteins, forming a transient **receptor–cargo complex**.  
This complex docks at the peroxisomal membrane through interactions with **PEX13** and **PEX14**, which together constitute the import machinery.  
After cargo translocation, **PEX5** is recycled to the cytosol for subsequent transport cycles.

To engineer efficient peroxisomal targeting in *Yarrowia lipolytica*, we incorporated the classical **PTS1 (–SKL)** signal at the C-terminus of peptides.  
Beyond the minimal SKL motif, we designed two extended variants—**GGGSSKL** and **TYWIRFSKL**—to systematically evaluate how linker length and composition affect **PEX5** recognition.  
The design rationale was that a **flexible linker (GGGS)** could increase accessibility of the SKL motif, while an **aromatic-rich segment (TYWIRF)** might provide additional stabilizing interactions.

These three peptide designs were fused to the eight key enzymes of the **MVA pathway** (*Erg8, Erg9, Erg10, Erg13, Erg20, Hmgr, Idi,* and *Merg12*), providing the foundation for subsequent molecular docking analysis.

 *An animation illustrates this process: enzyme–SKL forms a complex with PEX5, which then docks with PEX14 and PEX13; IDRs of PEX13 undergo liquid–liquid phase separation to generate a transient liquid cavity that facilitates import.*
