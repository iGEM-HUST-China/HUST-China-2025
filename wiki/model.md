## Our Model

Engineering peroxisomal protein targeting and rewiring central carbon metabolism in *Yarrowia lipolytica* poses a formidable design challenge: the import efficiency of linker–signal peptides, the catalytic bottleneck imposed by pathway rate-limiting enzymes, and the nonlinear dynamics of growth under complex carbon sources are deeply intertwined. Trial-and-error approaches alone cannot efficiently resolve this multi-layered problem.

To bridge this gap, we established a **hierarchical in silico pipeline** that acts as a digital twin of our PICasSO-inspired engineering strategy, enabling rational design and predictive prototyping.

### Molecular Layer — Peptide–Enzyme Docking

At the molecular interface, we employed **HADDOCK-based peptide–enzyme docking** to interrogate the binding determinants of classical and extended PTS1 variants (*SKL*, *GGGSSKL*, *TYWIRFSKL*). These simulations uncovered the energetic and structural principles that govern efficient recognition by **PEX5** and defined rational rules for designing import signals.

### Enzyme Layer — AI-Guided Sequence Redesign

To relieve metabolic bottlenecks, we targeted the **rate-limiting enzyme of the MVA pathway**. Using **ProteinMPNN**, we performed *de novo* sequence redesign to generate optimized variants, followed by **Rosetta FastRelax** refinement to minimize conformational strain energy. This computational protein engineering strategy yielded enzyme variants with enhanced stability and binding properties, thereby providing a robust starting point for experimental implementation.

### Systems Layer — Machine Learning Growth Modeling

To connect molecular insights with systems-level behavior, we constructed a **machine learning–driven growth modeling framework**. Experimental OD₆₀₀ kinetics were first parameterized using **Gompertz** and **spline** fits, extracting μₘₐₓ, λ, and K. These kinetic features, combined with medium composition variables, were used to train **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** models capable of forecasting growth performance under novel carbon-source combinations. This predictive capacity enables extrapolation beyond measured conditions and provides a quantitative basis for rational medium optimization.

### Integration and Impact

By fusing **molecular docking**, **AI-guided enzyme redesign**, and **machine learning–based systems modeling** into a unified framework, our model enables *in silico* prototyping of peroxisomal targeting and metabolic rewiring. This **model-driven strategy** transforms the traditional **Design–Build–Test–Learn (DBTL)** cycle into a **predictive, knowledge-**

# I. Linker–Signal Peptide System Docking

**Signal-peptide & linker selection · Molecular docking · Energy analysis**

## Background & Rationale

Peroxisomal protein import relies on **peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS)** and their cytosolic receptors.  
Two major types exist: **PTS1**, a canonical C-terminal tripeptide such as –SKL, and **PTS2**, a nonapeptide motif near the N-terminus.  
Among these, **PTS1** is the most conserved and widely used signal across eukaryotes.

The cytosolic receptor **PEX5** specifically recognizes PTS1-containing proteins, forming a transient **receptor–cargo complex**.  
This complex docks at the peroxisomal membrane through interactions with **PEX13** and **PEX14**, which together constitute the import machinery.  
After cargo translocation, **PEX5** is recycled to the cytosol for subsequent transport cycles.

To engineer efficient peroxisomal targeting in *Yarrowia lipolytica*, we incorporated the classical **PTS1 (–SKL)** signal at the C-terminus of peptides.  
Beyond the minimal SKL motif, we designed two extended variants—**GGGSSKL** and **TYWIRFSKL**—to systematically evaluate how linker length and composition affect **PEX5** recognition.  
The design rationale was that a **flexible linker (GGGS)** could increase accessibility of the SKL motif, while an **aromatic-rich segment (TYWIRF)** might provide additional stabilizing interactions.

These three peptide designs were fused to the eight key enzymes of the **MVA pathway** (*Erg8, Erg9, Erg10, Erg13, Erg20, Hmgr, Idi,* and *Merg12*), providing the foundation for subsequent molecular docking analysis.

 *An animation illustrates this process: enzyme–SKL forms a complex with PEX5, which then docks with PEX14 and PEX13; IDRs of PEX13 undergo liquid–liquid phase separation to generate a transient liquid cavity that facilitates import.*

# II. Molecular Docking

## Energy Terms and Scoring Principles

The HADDOCK docking protocol is fundamentally a physics-based and restraint-driven platform. It evaluates docking poses by combining several key energy terms:

- **van der Waals interactions**: Describing repulsion and attraction between atoms, preventing steric clashes while capturing hydrophobic stabilization.  

- **Electrostatics**: Coulombic interactions between charged residues, essential for PEX5 recognition of signal peptides.  

- **Desolvation energy**: Reflecting the free-energy change of amino acid residues when buried at the interface. Hydrophobic burial is favorable, while polar residues require compensating hydrogen bonds or salt bridges.  

The desolvation energy term can be expressed as:


<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center;">

$$
E_{\text{desolv}} = \sum_{i,j} S_i V_j \exp\left(-\frac{r_{ij}^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

</div>


- **Ambiguous Interaction Restraints (AIRs)**: Experimentally derived or hypothesized distance restraints that bias docking toward biologically relevant solutions.  

The restraint energy is defined as:


<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center;">

$$
E_{\text{air}} = \sum_k W_k (d_k - d_{0,k})^2
$$

</div>


At different docking stages (rigid body, semi-flexible refinement, water refinement), these energy terms are combined with varying weights into the final HADDOCK score. Additionally, **Buried Surface Area (BSA)** is used to quantify the size and compactness of the interface.  

The overall scoring function is:


<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center;">

$$
\text{Score} = w_{\text{vdW}} E_{\text{vdW}} + w_{\text{elec}} E_{\text{elec}} + w_{\text{desolv}} E_{\text{desolv}} + w_{\text{air}} E_{\text{air}} - w_{\text{BSA}}\cdot \text{BSA}
$$

</div>


Thus, HADDOCK scoring integrates both atomic-level physical interactions and experimental constraints, rather than relying on geometry alone.


## Structure Preparation

To systematically investigate peroxisomal targeting, we collected structural information for the eight key enzymes of the *Yarrowia lipolytica* MVA pathway (*Erg8, Erg9, Erg10, Erg13, Erg20, Hmgr, Idi, Merg12*). Experimental structures were retrieved from the PDB database, and missing structures were completed by homology modeling.  

We designed three C-terminal signal peptide tags: the canonical SKL motif, the flexible extended GGGSSKL, and the aromatic-rich TYWIRFSKL. These tags were fused to the eight enzymes, and complete inputs were generated with AlphaFold predictions.


## Docking Workflow

Docking simulations were performed with HADDOCK 2.4 for PEX5 against each enzyme–peptide fusion. In total, 24 independent jobs (3 peptides × 8 enzymes) were executed. Each job produced ~300 poses at the rigid-body stage (it0), yielding ~14,400 initial poses overall. After semi-flexible refinement (it1) and water refinement, 2,880 water-refined models were retained, consistent with the typical ~1:5 (it1:it0) selection ratio.  

Clustering by interface RMSD reduced the dataset to ~192 representative complexes. Based on HADDOCK scores, buried surface area (BSA), and conformational diversity, 24 best-performing complexes were selected for downstream energy analysis and visualization.


## Definition of Active Residues

To focus docking on biologically relevant regions, active residues were explicitly defined. For PEX5, the TPR repeat hot-spot residues (364, 398, 438, 469, 476, 501, 507, 585) were selected. For the MVA enzymes, the C-terminal linker+SKL regions were defined as active sites, reproducing the natural recognition of PTS1 signals by PEX5.


## Scoring and Visualization

Docking results were evaluated with the HADDOCK scoring function, which integrates van der Waals, electrostatics, desolvation, and restraint energies, combined with BSA to quantify interface size (Figure 1).  

Representative complexes were visualized in PyMOL and ChimeraX to illustrate hydrogen-bond networks and structural overlays. The results confirmed the plausibility of docking poses and highlighted distinct recognition patterns between the minimal and extended signal peptides at the PEX5 interface.
