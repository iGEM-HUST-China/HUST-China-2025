## 1.Education 
### 1.1Advancing New Quality Productive Forces through Synthetic Biology
#### A specialized interview on "New Quality Productive Forces"

HUST-China was invited to discuss the role of synthetic biology in driving the development of new-quality productive forces. As one of the team leaders, Zou Wanting introduced our team's background and achievements, elaborating in detail on how synthetic biology aligns with new-quality productive forces by promoting technological innovation and sustainable development.

We systematically elucidated the intrinsic connection between synthetic biology and new-quality productive forces, while analyzing and emphasizing the following key points:

1.Synthetic biology surpasses traditional production methods by introducing editable, life-based manufacturing platforms.

2.Compared to conventional processes, it significantly reduces energy consumption and waste generation, reflecting its efficiency in resource utilization and environmental sustainability.

This interview showcased how synthetic biology contributes to sustainable industrial transformation．Looking forward, we foresee that the integration of synthetic biology with transformative technologies like artificial intelligence will profoundly accelerate the development of New Quality Productive Forces, unlocking breakthroughs in critical domains such as carbon neutrality, smart agriculture, and precision medicine.

### 1.2 Science popularization education activities

Throughout our human practices activities, we have identified a significant knowledge gap in synthetic biology among non-biology majors and the general public. To address this, we have designed and implemented a series of science education initiatives targeting different age groups, spanning from basic education to higher education, to promote innovative concepts in synthetic biology.

#### 1.2.1 “Huaxiaomiao” Classroom Fun Enlightenment: Gene Expression Structure and Components

In the "Huaxiaomiao" weekend class organized by the University Youth League Committee, Labor Union, and School of Life Science, we conducted engaging science outreach on synthetic biology for 28 science-loving primary students. Through well-designed interactive games and vivid analogies, we transformed complex gene expression structures and functional parts into comprehensible modules, allowing children to experience the unique appeal of synthetic biology in areas like environmental remediation through hands-on activities, sowing the seeds for future scientific talent.

#### 1.2.3 Professional Knowledge Seminar at Tianmen Middle School

In the school science festival extension activity, we visited Tianmen Middle School in Hubei Province to provide professional science education to high school students. Through microscopic observation of our project's self-developed novel yeast strains and displays of macro samples on culture media, students gained intuitive understanding of synthetic biology's engineering capabilities. Volunteers from the iGEM team detailed the special functions and culture conditions of the strains, sparking strong interest in biotechnology among numerous students.

#### 1.2.4 Promotional Tour at Wen Deng and Jiangxi Affiliated High Schools

Several team members utilized winter break to revisit Wen Deng New First Middle School and Jiangxi Normal University Affiliated High School, delivering specialized presentations on synthetic biology to students and parents. At the project introduction session of Wen Deng District University Student Union and the promotion event at the affiliated high school, team members presented our team's annual work and achievements in iGEM competitions. Through systematic introduction of the discipline's research fields and development prospects, along with specific project explanations, they effectively enhanced middle school students' understanding of biotechnology. The enthusiastic interactions following the sessions reflected the young generation's strong interest in cutting-edge technology, establishing a solid foundation for talent development in this discipline.

## 2.Communication 
### 2.1 Communicate with BIT-China iGEM team
#### 2.1.1 Introduction

In July, 2025, we engaged in a productive exchange with the BIT-China iGEM team. Both teams presented their project progress and shared insights on experimental design and practical implementation, which brought valuable inspiration and ideas.

#### 2.1.2 Sharing of experience

A key part of our discussion focused on social practice and human practices. We shared our respective experiences in conducting science outreach and engaging with the public. For example, we discussed our initiatives in community education and demonstrated how iGEM projects can extend beyond the lab to create tangible social value, offering us valuable perspectives on amplifying the societal impact of our own work.

#### 2.1.3 Significance
During the exchange between iGEM teams, we not only shared project progress but also exchanged new ideas and perspectives. Besides, by sharing experiences, we provided insights into each other's social and human practices, which broadened our horizons and offered valuable references for allocating focus in subsequent work.

### 2.2 The 12th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC)
#### 2.2.1 Introduction

CCiC is a premier event initiated by iGEM teams in mainland China, designed to provide a platform for resource sharing, mutual learning, and communication. During the critical preparation period in August, the HUST-China team attended the 12th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) in Beijing, engaging with top domestic teams to exchange ideas, gain valuable experience, and broaden our perspectives.

#### 2.2.2 Key Takeaways
Over the three-day conference, our team gained immensely：

1.By attending frontier presentations, we learned about the latest innovations in synthetic biology. 

2.Participating in round-table discussions, absorbing key competition insights and broadening our approach to project design and innovation. 

3.During the parallel project presentation and poster sessions, we introduced our Squalene project to teams nationwide, garnering significant attention. While observing the presentations of multiple teams, we learned narrative techniques crucial for effectively communicating a project's core value and creative points.

We also actively engaged with other teams' progress and delved into in-depth discussions at the poster zone, where vibrant conversations on experimental design, modeling, and human practices led to constructive feedback and the sharing of invaluable experiences.

#### 2.2.3 The value of collaborative communication

The CCiC conference has clearly charted the course for our subsequent work through learning from our peers, while enabling us to reflect on the shortcomings and issues within our project design and engage in developing practical solutions.

### 2.3 Synbio Challenges 2025
#### 2.3.1 Introduction

Together with the 2024 HUST-China team members, we participated in the Synbio Challenges 2025. This competition, organized by the Chinese Society of Biotechnology (CSBT), brought together over 200 teams from domestic and international universities, comprising nearly 1,900 young talents.

#### 2.3.2 National Gold Award Achievement

The HUST-China team was awarded the National Gold Award for its previous project, "A Closed-Loop System for PET Microplastic Degradation, Conversion, and Application Based on Microbial Metabolic Coupling." This project innovatively utilized engineered E. coli BL21 and Pseudomonas putida KT2440 in a synergistic system to achieve closed-loop processing of PET microplastics, demonstrating significant potential in addressing global microplastic pollution. The successful experience from this project provides valuable insights and a foundation for our current year's work.

#### 2.3.3 Collaboration with National Top Teams

The competition provided us with a platform to interact with outstanding synthetic biology teams from across the nation. It served as an opportunity to discuss projects and share knowledge. Through these exchanges, we gained new technical insights and interdisciplinary perspectives, which have been incorporated into the refinement of this year's project plan.
