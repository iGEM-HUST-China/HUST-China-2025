## 2.Communication 
### 2.1 Communicate with BIT-China iGEM team
#### 2.1.1 Introduction

In July, 2025, we engaged in a productive exchange with the BIT-China iGEM team. Both teams presented their project progress and shared insights on experimental design and practical implementation, which brought valuable inspiration and ideas.

#### 2.1.2 Sharing of experience

A key part of our discussion focused on social practice and human practices. We shared our respective experiences in conducting science outreach and engaging with the public. For example, we discussed our initiatives in community education and demonstrated how iGEM projects can extend beyond the lab to create tangible social value, offering us valuable perspectives on amplifying the societal impact of our own work.

#### 2.1.3 Significance
During the exchange between iGEM teams, we not only shared project progress but also exchanged new ideas and perspectives. Besides, by sharing experiences, we provided insights into each other's social and human practices, which broadened our horizons and offered valuable references for allocating focus in subsequent work.

### 2.2 The 12th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC)
#### 2.2.1 Introduction

CCiC is a premier event initiated by iGEM teams in mainland China, designed to provide a platform for resource sharing, mutual learning, and communication. During the critical preparation period in August, the HUST-China team attended the 12th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) in Beijing, engaging with top domestic teams to exchange ideas, gain valuable experience, and broaden our perspectives.

#### 2.2.2 Key Takeaways
Over the three-day conference, our team gained immensely：

1.By attending frontier presentations, we learned about the latest innovations in synthetic biology. 

2.Participating in round-table discussions, absorbing key competition insights and broadening our approach to project design and innovation. 

3.During the parallel project presentation and poster sessions, we introduced our Squalene project to teams nationwide, garnering significant attention. While observing the presentations of multiple teams, we learned narrative techniques crucial for effectively communicating a project's core value and creative points.

We also actively engaged with other teams' progress and delved into in-depth discussions at the poster zone, where vibrant conversations on experimental design, modeling, and human practices led to constructive feedback and the sharing of invaluable experiences.

#### 2.2.3 The value of collaborative communication

The CCiC conference has clearly charted the course for our subsequent work through learning from our peers, while enabling us to reflect on the shortcomings and issues within our project design and engage in developing practical solutions.

### 2.3 Synbio Challenges 2025
#### 2.3.1 Introduction

Together with the 2024 HUST-China team members, we participated in the Synbio Challenges 2025. This competition, organized by the Chinese Society of Biotechnology (CSBT), brought together over 200 teams from domestic and international universities, comprising nearly 1,900 young talents.

#### 2.3.2 National Gold Award Achievement

The HUST-China team was awarded the National Gold Award for its previous project, "A Closed-Loop System for PET Microplastic Degradation, Conversion, and Application Based on Microbial Metabolic Coupling." This project innovatively utilized engineered E. coli BL21 and Pseudomonas putida KT2440 in a synergistic system to achieve closed-loop processing of PET microplastics, demonstrating significant potential in addressing global microplastic pollution. The successful experience from this project provides valuable insights and a foundation for our current year's work.

#### 2.3.3 Collaboration with National Top Teams

The competition provided us with a platform to interact with outstanding synthetic biology teams from across the nation. It served as an opportunity to discuss projects and share knowledge. Through these exchanges, we gained new technical insights and interdisciplinary perspectives, which have been incorporated into the refinement of this year's project plan.
