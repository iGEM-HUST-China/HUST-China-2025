{% include figure.html image="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5569/hp/1.webp" caption="Figure 1.1 Zou is being interviewed" %}

HUST-China was invited to discuss the role of synthetic biology in driving the development of new-quality productive forces. As one of the team leaders, Zou Wanting introduced our team's background and achievements, elaborating in detail on how synthetic biology aligns with new-quality productive forces by promoting technological innovation and sustainable development.

We systematically elucidated the intrinsic connection between synthetic biology and new-quality productive forces, while analyzing and emphasizing the following key points:

1.Synthetic biology surpasses traditional production methods by introducing editable, life-based manufacturing platforms.

2.Compared to conventional processes, it significantly reduces energy consumption and waste generation, reflecting its efficiency in resource utilization and environmental sustainability.

This interview showcased how synthetic biology contributes to sustainable industrial transformation．Looking forward, we foresee that the integration of synthetic biology with transformative technologies like artificial intelligence will profoundly accelerate the development of New Quality Productive Forces, unlocking breakthroughs in critical domains such as carbon neutrality, smart agriculture, and precision medicine.

### 1.2 Science popularization education activities

Throughout our human practices activities, we have identified a significant knowledge gap in synthetic biology among non-biology majors and the general public. To address this, we have designed and implemented a series of science education initiatives targeting different age groups, spanning from basic education to higher education, to promote innovative concepts in synthetic biology.

#### 1.2.1 “Huaxiaomiao” Classroom Fun Enlightenment: Gene Expression Structure and Components

In the "Huaxiaomiao" weekend class organized by the University Youth League Committee, Labor Union, and School of Life Science, we conducted engaging science outreach on synthetic biology for 28 science-loving primary students. Through well-designed interactive games and vivid analogies, we transformed complex gene expression structures and functional parts into comprehensible modules, allowing children to experience the unique appeal of synthetic biology in areas like environmental remediation through hands-on activities, sowing the seeds for future scientific talent.

#### 1.2.2 Liren Community Summer Camp: Hands-on Experience in Genetic Design

During the Liren Community Summer Camp, we innovatively presented principles of synthetic biology through game-based formats that appeal to children. During the activity, we deconstructed plasmid components into separate modular stickers, such as promoters, terminators, and functional genes. After acquiring essential theoretical knowledge before the game, the children could freely unleash their imagination—starting by building plasmids with basic functions and eventually combining various plasmids of different sizes and functions, transforming into junior "synthetic biology researchers." Depending on specific gene segments, some of the plasmids they created could absorb heavy metals, while others produced pigments, and so on. By simplifying functional units like promoters and genes into building block-like modules, we guided children to assemble these modules into "cells" after understanding basic concepts. This approach not only cultivated their systematic thinking and creativity but also demonstrated the core design philosophy of standardization and modularization in synthetic biology.

{% include figure.html image="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5569/hp/4.webp" caption="Figure 1.2.4 On-campus Outreach Talk" %}
Several team members utilized winter break to revisit Wen Deng New First Middle School and Jiangxi Normal University Affiliated High School, delivering specialized presentations on synthetic biology to students and parents. At the project introduction session of Wen Deng District University Student Union and the promotion event at the affiliated high school, team members presented our team's annual work and achievements in iGEM competitions. Through systematic introduction of the discipline's research fields and development prospects, along with specific project explanations, they effectively enhanced middle school students' understanding of biotechnology. The enthusiastic interactions following the sessions reflected the young generation's strong interest in cutting-edge technology, establishing a solid foundation for talent development in this discipline.

#### 1.2.5 Contributing to the "Debunking Synthetic Biology Myths" Collaborative Project

Invited to contribute to the "Debunking Synthetic Biology Myths" science handbook co-compiled by 33 universities nationwide, our team fully leveraged our professional expertise to author authoritative explanations addressing common public misconceptions. This collaborative achievement significantly enhanced the accuracy and reach of science communication, demonstrating the social responsibility and professional commitment of iGEM teams in the field of scientific outreach.

In this manual, we debunk three myths related to synthetic biology:

1.Addressing the misunderstanding about biotechnology that "Synthetic biology is just 'Gene Editing'under a new name", we distinguish the operational differences between gene editing and synthetic biology. Unlike the single-point modifications of the former, synthetic biology emphasizes modularity and engineering principles, enabling biological systems to be designed and optimized like "building blocks".

2.Regarding the misunderstanding and product safety concerns behind the question "You're using waste oil in your experiments--does that mean the waste oil ends up being sold as cosmetics?", we explain that through specific fermentation, yeast decomposes waste oil and reconstructs its molecules into entirely new, safe products (such as squalene). The final product has no direct connection to the waste oil used as raw material itself.

3.In response to the opposition between "natural" and "man-made" reflected in the view that "Only natural products are truly healthy. Microbial-derived ingredients can't compare with those extracted from sharks or plants", we clarify from a microscopic perspective that squalene synthesized by microorganisms is chemically identical to its natural counterpart. It is not only environmentally friendly but also ensures a stable supply of high-purity raw materials.

This collaborative achievement significantly enhanced the accuracy and reach of science communication, demonstrating the social responsibility and professional commitment of iGEM teams in the field of scientific outreach.
