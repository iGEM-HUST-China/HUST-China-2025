## Part I: Problem Definition & Value Discovery

{% include dropdown.html
   title="Confirming the Unsustainability of Animal-Derived Squalene"
   content="Who we contacted: Fisherman Uncle Sun from Weihai, Shandong; Oceana reports; Policies from China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.

Why: To understand from the source whether large-scale commercial shark fishing for squalene exists in China's coastal areas.

What we learned:
- No specialized shark fishing industry in Chinese coastal waters
- Sharks caught are mostly 'bycatch' during deep-sea operations
- Oceana reports reveal threat to shark populations from cosmetics industry
- National policies prohibit new construction of vessels primarily targeting sharks

How we adapted: Strengthened our fundamental stance on finding alternatives, anchoring project value in ecological protection and sustainable development."

   title="Clarifying Industry Demand for Sustainable Ingredients"
   content="Who we contacted: Proya Cosmetics, Wuhan Berca Biomedical, Hubei Hongfuda Biotechnology, and other industry players.

What we learned:
- Market strongly prefers 'non-animal derived' ingredients
- Extreme requirements for safety and stability
- Insufficient supply is a real industry pain point

How we adapted: Defined final product as squalene and planned full third-party safety testing procedures."

   title="Discovering High-Value Conversion Potential of Waste Oil"
   content="Who we contacted: Zhejiang Zhengda Environmental Protection, waste oil recycling managers.

What we learned:
- Current waste oil to biodiesel conversion has meager profits (~8.5 RMB/kg)
- Industry urgently needs high-value conversion pathways
- 20mg high-purity squalene worth 800 RMB vs 1kg biodiesel at 8.5 RMB

How we adapted: Solidified core innovation of 'upgrading waste oil to squalene,' extending story from environmental protection to circular economy."

   title="Project Positioning in 'Fashion' Track"
   content="Who we contacted: 200+ consumer questionnaire respondents.

What we learned:
- 75% of respondents had positive or curious first reaction
- 68% concerned about safety
- 'Fashion Pioneer Story' (41%) most popular narrative preference

How we adapted: Positioned project in 'Fashion' track, creating brand narrative combining technology, environmental protection, and lifestyle."

## Part II: Technical Path Construction & Key Iterations

### Ideal Chassis Organism Finalization

**Consultation:** Prof. Tang Qiang from USTC

**Key Insight:** *Yarrowia lipolytica* is ideal choice - natural lipid metabolism capability and complete MVA pathway.

**Adaptation:** Formally selected *Yarrowia lipolytica* as project chassis.

### Lipase Introduction

**Consultation:** Prof. Yan Yunjun from HUST

**Problem:** Wild-type strain degradation efficiency insufficient

**Solution:** Introduced exogenous TLL lipase from *Aspergillus oryzae*

### Rate-Limiting Enzyme Optimization

**Consultation:** Prof. Ning Kang from HUST

**Approach:** Used ProteinMPNN and Rosetta for protein redesign to reduce conformational frustration and improve stability.

### Mining Novel HMGR Homologs

**Consultation:** Prof. Shi Mang from Sun Yat-sen University

**Tool:** Integrated Foldseek for 3D structure-based homology search

**Method:** Set 90% structural consistency threshold for reliable functional inference

### Compartmentalization Strategy

**Consultation:** Researcher Xie Xiaoman from HUST

**Problem:** Squalene accumulation toxicity and feedback regulation

**Solution:** Relocated entire MVA pathway to peroxisomes for optimized micro-reaction environment

## Part III: Product Positioning & Engineering Implementation

### Establishing Integrated Hardware Design Principles

**Challenge:** Expensive micro-fermentation equipment, complex operations, contamination risk

**Consultation:** National Bio-manufacturing Industry Innovation Center, Hubei University

**Solution:** Designed Integrated Fermentation & Processing System (iFPS)

### Hardware Material and Automation Upgrades

**Consultations:** HUST Engineering Innovation Center, Dr. Chen Yulong

**Improvements:**
- Photosensitive resin for better density and temperature resistance
- PCB boards replacing breadboards
- Baffled fermentation design for oxygen dissolution
- Expanded application scenarios

## Part IV: Compliance, Safety & Future Planning

### Strengthening Raw Material Safety & Compliance

**Consultation:** Bloomage Bio Chief Formulator

**Key Concerns:** Complex waste oil composition may inhibit microbial growth

**Adaptation:** Added waste oil pretreatment module and mandatory third-party safety assessment

### Recognizing Downstream Industrialization Bottlenecks

**Experience:** Visit to Zhejiang Lanhaixing filling line

**Learning:** Downstream packaging can become efficiency bottleneck due to product viscosity

**Adaptation:** Enhanced focus on compatibility with industrial equipment

### Project Prospects

**International Recognition:** Prof. Sylvain FISSON from University of Evry Paris-Saclay

**Assessment:** Project has significant practical meaning and scientific prospects

**Future:** Invitation for further discussion and development

## Project Origin

The project began when team members questioned the term "Natural Plant Squalane" on cosmetics during 2024 summer vacation, sparking investigation into this high-value cosmetic ingredient and its sustainability challenges.

**Key Findings:**
- Animal sources involve ecological ethical controversies
- Plant sources face high environmental costs and prices
- China produces millions of tons of waste cooking oil annually
- Opportunity to create "waste oil to squalene" green cycle
